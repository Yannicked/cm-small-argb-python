Small reverse engineering effort on controlling the Cooler Master Small ARGB Controller using python.

Notes are in reverse-engineer-argb.txt

This only works on firmware version v004 as of yet.

I am not sure what changed in firmware v008 as the new masterplus software does not support addressable rgb control
